== Introduction

Kerberos is a network authentication protocol that allows the network node to prove its identity over the network.
It does so by using a Key Distribution Center (KDC) to ensure that the client identity is correct.
In addition to security, Kerberos also supports single sign-on.
This allows for granting users access to the database after signing in to the computer, thus providing simplicity for users.

Neo4j supports the use of Kerberos, using the _Neo4j Kerberos Add-on_ described in this documentation.

[NOTE]
====
The Neo4j Kerberos Add-on v{kerberos-add-on-version} is compatible with all releases of Neo4j v4 and Neo4j v5.
